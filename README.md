## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are used to reorder elements in a list or array according to a specific order, such as ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is crucial for optimizing the performance of other algorithms that require sorted data.

## Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are included in this repository:

1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison-based algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist.
3. **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, with the assumption that the first item is already sorted.
4. **Quick Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array around the pivot.


## Usage

To use any of the sorting algorithms, clone the repository and run the desired algorithm's implementation in your preferred programming language. Each algorithm is contained within its own directory with instructions on how to compile and run it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/holbertonschool-sorting_algorithms.git
cd holbertonschool-sorting_algorithms
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a new sorting algorithm or an improvement to an existing one, please fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request.
